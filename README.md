# Tasks

### About
This is my second implementation of MVVM model. I have built a simple tasks app.
You can create tasks which are reminders to keep tracks of things you need to do.
You can perform CRUD operation on these tasks. To easily manage tasks, you can create
task Lists and then manage individual list.


My goal of creating this project was to
- Get more acquainted with MVVM Model
- Create intermediate level of UI as per [design](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/66/90/096690271d56597060303768b94169d1.jpg)
- Create a simple note application that is robust and appealing


### Things I learnt while creating this project:
- In depth understanding of Room database
- Using View model with coroutines to manage all data logic (business) logic
- Navigation UI
- Handling fragments
- Working with drawables to achieve custom effects on views
- Fragment Animation
- Working with livedata (Introduction to kotlin flows)
- Splashscreen API
- Creating Notification and managing PendingIntents
- AlarmManager to schedule tasks
- An introduction to Android Services and Broadcasts
- Item selection in RecyclerView
- Working with ActionBar and Contextual Action Mode of ActionBar

### Pending stuff
- Change list layout as per view type
- Sorting tasks

### Stuff for future
- Add Calendar section to see a glimpse of distribution of tasks
- Add settings to manage notifications depending upon priority
